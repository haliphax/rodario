## About

This is a thought experiment with two desired outcomes: that I wind up learning
a lot about the actor model and its idiosyncrasies as I build the project, and
that I wind up with a useable library when all is said and done. I care much
more about the first than I do the second. As such, it is not recommended at
this time that you even consider using this in production code. All of the
GitHub releases are marked as "pre-release", and all of the versions on pypi
have an alpha designator, but I figured being completely explicit about this
was probably best.
